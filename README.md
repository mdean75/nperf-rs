# nperf
A portable network performance measurement tool for TCP/UDP/QUIC/TLS protocols. Similar to iperf3 in usage.

Supported on Linux and Windows. (macos coming soon)

QUIC protocol testing uses the [quinn](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn) QUIC implementation. Future support for [Quiche](https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche) is WIP.

## Differences to iperf3
- nperf works on Windows
- QUIC is newly supported in nperf
- TLS (tls over tcp) is newly supported in nperf
- Some CLI options yet to be supported in nperf and some are WIP
- SCTP is unsupported
- No support for --bidir
- Added support for optional 2 byte payload length header, big endian encoded

## Usage
- Both server and client must use same setting for the optional header (both must have it enabled or both must have it disabled) in order for payloads to be processed correctly
- Verbose mode provides additional metrics that significantly impacts throughput performance
```shell
Usage:
  nperf [OPTIONS]

[s] server only, [c] client only, [sc] both, [KMG] option supports a K/M/G
suffix for kilo-, mega-, or giga-

Optional arguments:
  -h,--help             Show this help message and exit
  -s,--server           [s] Start perf as server
  -c,--client CLIENT    [c] Start perf as client, connecting to <host>,
                        (default 127.0.0.1)
  -p,--port PORT        [sc] Port server listens on / client connects to,
                        (default 8080)
  -u,--udp              [c] Use UDP
  -q,--quic             [c] Use QUIC
  --tls                 [c] Use TLS
  -B,--bind-addr BIND_ADDR
                        [s] Bind address to listen on, (default [::])
  -b,--bitrate BITRATE  [c] [KMG] target bitrate in bits/sec, (default
                        unlimited)
  -t,--time TIME        [c] time in seconds to transmit for (default 10 secs)
  -n,--bytes BYTES      [c] [KMG] target number of bytes to transmit (instead
                        of -t)
  -k,--blocks BLOCKS    [c] number of blocks (packets) to transmit (instead of
                        -t or -n)
  -l,--length LENGTH    [c] [KMG] length of buffer to read or write in bytes,
                        maximum for TCP - 128KB, UDP/QUIC - 64KB (default ctrl
                        connection MSS)
  -P,--parallel PARALLEL
                        [c] number of parallel client streams to run
  -M,--set-mss SET_MSS  [c] set TCP maximum segment size
  --skip-tls            [c] Disable QUIC connection encryption
  --tls-cert TLS_CERT   [s] TLS certificate file (in PEM format) path
  --tls-key TLS_KEY     [s] TLS key file (in DER format) path
  -V,--verbose          [sc] Enable verbose logging
  -d,--debug            [sc] Enable debug logging
  --add-header          [sc] Enable length header
```

### Server
```bash
# binds to [::]:8080 by default
cargo run -- -s

# start server with header enabled
cargo run -- -s -B 127.0.0.1 -p 8000 --add-header
```

### Client
```bash
# run test with header enabled and 500 byte payloads
cargo run -- -c 127.0.0.1 -p 8000 -l 500 --add-header

# connects to 127.0.0.1:8080 by default and test TCP streams
cargo run --
cargo run -- -c 127.0.0.1

# Test TLS performance
cargo run -- --tls

# Test UDP performance
cargo run -- -u

# Test QUIC performance
cargo run -- -q

# Test with parallel streams using -P, period to test with -t
cargo run -- -u -P 2 -t 30
```

## Future
- Support for send/recv buffer sizes
- More performance and configuration options for QUIC
